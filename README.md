# Sudoku Solver

Created an application to solve sudoku using backtracking.
This app is currently [hosted here](https://solve-sudoku-fast.herokuapp.com/)

To run it locally:
<ul>
    <li>Install the requirements by the command 
        <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code>
</li>
<li>
    Run the main function in app.py by the command 
    <code>python app.py</code>
</li>
</ul>


Note: I am currently working on a way to verify whether the given sudoku is valid to be solved or not.
